Beware of mini-sized snacks -- small crackers, cookies, and pretzels. Most people end up eating more than they realize, and the calories add up.
Choose foods packaged in individual serving sizes.
If you like to eat ice cream out of the carton, pick up ice cream sandwiches or other individual-size servings.
